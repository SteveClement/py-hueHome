# OSRAM LIGHTIFY

The e14 version of the OSRAM bulb worked out of the box.

There seem to be differences beteween the US (120V) versions and the EU (230V) versions.

Where the US versions seem to give you some grief in trying to add them easily via the HUE mobile apps.

For the EU versions just:

- Open App and search for new lights
- Switch on the Light
- Configure
